Simple tasks with arrays

Solution of the following tasks, each task has an individual button. It is not allowed to use built-in functions of searching and sorting, except the ‘random’ method.
Common interface for all tasks:
1. CountNumber – an input field for an amount of numbers
2. SearchNumber - an input field for a search number
3. InputStr - an input field for string processing
4. SearchStr - an input field for a search string
5. Result - an input field for display of the result
Tasks
1. Display a CountNumber-sized Array of random integers in the Result field.
2. Display a CountNumber-sized Array of random integers in the Result field. Display a Min and Max integers of the Array.
3. Display a 2D CountNumber CountNumber-sized Array of random integers in the Result field.
4. Display a 2D CountNumber CountNumber-sized Array of random integers in the Result field. Display a Min and Max integers of the Array.
5. Display a 2D CountNumber CountNumber-sized Array of random integers in the Result field. Display a number of a SearchNumber entry occurrences in the Array.
6. Display a number of a SearchStr entry occurrences in the InputStr string in the Result field. The search must be case-insensitive.
7. Display a result of the every CountNumber word removal from the InputStr string in the Result field.
8 . Display the most common character from the InputStr string in the Result field.
9 . Display a CountNumber-sized Array sorted in ascending order by using the Bubblesort algorithm.
10 . Display a 2D Array in the Result field. The output should be handled by iterator manipulation.
